The Final Project of the Computational Data Analysis course is an opportunity to use many of the skills and competencies acquired in previous courses. I invested many hours in the program, so completing this capstone project is like a big celebration of your learning achievements.

### Data used for this project:

[Fitbit fitness tracking data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public domain, dataset available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic)): This Kaggle dataset contains personal fitness tracking across thirty Fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to sending personal tracking data including physical activity performance in minutes, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps and heart rate that can be used to explore users' habits.
