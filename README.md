[Google Data Analysis - Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/programs/analisis-de-datos-de-google-llu5v/professional-certificates/analisis-de-datos-de-google?collectionId=nh37G)

Course program (8 courses):

* 1. Basics: Data, data, everywhere

* 2. Ask questions to make data-driven decisions

* 3. Prepare data for exploration

* 4. Process data to pass it clean

* 5. Analyze data to answer questions

* 6. Share data through the art of visualization

* 7. Data analysis with R programming

* 8. Google Computational Data Analysis Course Final Project: Complete a case study (this project)

The Final Project of the Computational Data Analysis course is an opportunity to use many of the skills and competencies acquired during the 8 courses. I invested many hours in the program, so completing this capstone project is like a celebration of the course being completed.

### Data used for this project:

[Fitbit fitness tracking data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public domain, dataset available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic)): This Kaggle dataset contains personal fitness tracking across thirty Fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to sending personal tracking data including physical activity performance in minutes, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps and heart rate that can be used to explore users' habits.
